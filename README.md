### Calculator

## Requirements for the calculator: the program must know 
- [] the 4 basic operations, 
- [] plus be able to subtract roots from positive integers and be able to square them
- [] the user should be able to enter numbers for the actions and be able to choose an action
- [] tell the user somehow if you want to subtract a root from a negative number or if you want to add letters
- [] make sure that the Main function and the methods created for the calculator are separated (for example, in a separate class). 

Also, it should really be foolproof, it will receive as many wrong inputs as possible and throw them back to the user, so you don't get stuck if the user writes letters or punctuation marks. It is advisable to use try-catch or switch-case. For example, try-catch can throw an exception in case of wrong type of input, and switch can be useful for selecting the function (addition, subtraction, etc.).
